# Frontend Mentor Challenges
Welcome to my [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge repository! Here, you'll find a collection of frontend challenges that I have completed. Each project was an opportunity to practice and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Note on Technology Choices
For these challenges, I chose not to use frameworks or libraries such as React, Angular, or Vue. My goal was to practice and strengthen my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the assistance of these tools. By focusing on the core technologies, I aimed to improve my understanding and ability to solve problems using the basics of frontend development.
